# Welcome to QR Catalyst Open Source Project

Welcome to QR Catalyst! We're big believers in open source software and want to share some useful components we've built.

This project contains small, standalone utilities that we use in our commercial work. We're open-sourcing them because we think other developers might find them helpful too.

We're sharing the building blocks while keeping our main commercial features private â€“ this way we can contribute to the community and still run a sustainable business.
